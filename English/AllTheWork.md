### Classwork (9-10)

Subject: Purchasing New Hardware

Dear Sir or Madam,

my small office is still using pretty old hardware
(5 Computers, running on WindowsXP), and we would like to invest in an upgrade.
We require new ones with a modern OS which enables us to link them, so every employee is able to work at any Computer.
Furthermore, we would need a delivery and installation from you at least in the next 5 to 6 weeks.

If you are able to meet our requirements, I would be very happy to hear about your terms of payment to fulfill this offer.

Kind regards

Tom Dameris
